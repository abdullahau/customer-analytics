This model presented in this notebook is a direct implementation of *Daniel M. McCarthy, Peter S. Fader and Bruce G. S. Hardie*'s 2016 paper [*Valuing Subscription-Based Businesses Using Publicly Disclosed Customer Data*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2701093).

I will also implement the models proposed by *Gupta, Sunil, Donald R. Lehmann, and Jennifer Ames Stuart* in their 2004 paper [*Valuing Customers*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=459595), and *Schulze, Christian, Bernd Skiera, and Thorsten Wiesel* in their 2012 paper [*Linking Customer and Financial Metrics to Shareholder Value: The Leverage Effect in Customer-Based Valuation*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.10.0280) as benchmarks.

## Introduction

The subscription-based business model—where customers pay recurring fees for ongoing access to a product or service—has seen significant growth beyond its traditional domains of media and telecom. Today, it underpins a wide range of consumer and B2B offerings, including SaaS (e.g., Microsoft 365), meal kits (e.g., Blue Apron), and consumer goods (e.g., Dollar Shave Club). A key driver of this model’s appeal is the predictability of revenue streams.

As subscription businesses scale, they increasingly disclose customer-related metrics such as **churn**, **acquisition cost** (CAC), **average revenue per user** (ARPU), and **customer lifetime value** (CLV). These metrics are critical for understanding a firm’s future cash flows—especially since, in subscription settings, customer behavior largely drives economic value. Equity analysts and investors now routinely incorporate this data into valuation models, with subscriber base growth often serving as a key signal.

In this notebook, I implement the framework (and its models) from [McCarthy, Fader, and Bruce (2016)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2701093), which estimates firm value using only publicly disclosed customer data. Central to this framework are models of the firm's **acquisition** and **retention processes**, which accommodate factors such as *customer heterogeneity*, *duration dependence*, *seasonality*, and *changes in population size*.

We explicitly account for the fact that publicly reported data are typically *aggregated* (temporally and across customers) and suffer from *missingness* (i.e., the reported data are not available for all periods). 

I begin by reviewing the principles of customer-based corporate valuation and the nature of the data available from subscription firms. I then introduce models for acquisition, retention, and spending behavior, and estimate their parameters using historical data from two publicly traded firms: Dish Network (DISH) and Sirius XM (SIRI).

Once validated, the model is used to generate forward-looking estimates of customer behavior, firm-level revenue, and ultimately, equity value. I also highlight additional strategic insights that emerge from the estimated parameters and model outputs.

## The Logic of Customer-Based Corporate Valuation

### Valuation 101

The framework summarized here is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, which is the de-facto industry standard way in which operating assets are valued within the financial community. At the heart of any such valuation exercise is the estimation of period-by-period FCF, central to which are estimates of period-by-period revenue.

Denoting the value of the firm at time $T$ by $\text{SHV}_T$ (for shareholder value), we have

$$
\text{SHV}_T = \text{OA} + \text{NOA}_T - \text{ND}_T
$$

The value of a firm’s operating assets ($\text{OA}$) is equal to the sum of all *expected* future free cash flows (FCFs) the firm will generate, discounted at the weighted average cost of capital ($\text{WACC}$):

$$
\text{OA}_T = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{\text{FCF}_{T+t}}{(1+\text{WACC})^{t}}
$$


FCF is equal to the net operating profit after taxes ($\text{NOPAT}$) minus the difference between capital expenditures ($\text{CAPEX}$) and depreciation and amortization ($\text{D\&A}$), minus the change in non-financial working capital ($\Delta\text{NFWC}$):

$$
\text{FCF}_t = \text{NOPAT}_t - (\text{CAPEX}_t - \text{D\&A}_t) - \Delta\text{NFWC}_t
$$

The most important ingredient of FCF is $\text{NOPAT}$, which is a measure of the underlying profitability of the operating assets of the firm. $\text{NOPAT}$ is equal to revenues ($\text{REV}$) times the contribution margin ratio ($1 - \text{VC}$) minus fixed operating costs ($\text{FC}$), after taxes (where $\text{TR}$ is the corporate tax rate for the firm):

$$
\text{NOPAT}_t = \left(\text{REV}_t \times (1 - \text{VC}) - \text{FC}_t \right) \times \left(1- \text{TR}_t\right)
$$

### A Data Structure for Subscription-Based Businesses

![](references/num_customer_matrix.png){fig-align="center" width="350"}


- $R(m)$ -> Monthly revenue
- $m = 1$ -> first month of commercial operations
- $C(m, m’)$ -> number of customers acquired by the firm in month $m$ who are still active in month $m’$
- $A(m) = C(m, m’)$ -> number of customers acquired each month by the firm
- $L(m)$ -> number of customers “lost” each month
- $L(m)$ = 0 if m = 0, else $C(., m-1) - [C(., m) - C(m,m)]$
	- eg. $L(3) = C(., 2) - [C(., 3) - C(3,3)]$
$$
L(m) = 
	\begin{cases}
		0 &\quad m =1 \\
		C(., m-1) - [C(., m) - C(m,m)]&\quad m = 2,3,4, \ldots
	\end{cases}
$$
- *Aggregate* churn rate = $L(m)/C(.,m-1)$
- $ARPU(m)$ -> Average revenue per subscriber in a given month
- $ARPU(m) = R(m) \big/ \frac{C(.,m-1) + C(.,m)}{2}$
	- (The denominator is the average number of customers the firm has during month $m$.)
- $q$ quarter is a temporal aggregation of the true underlying process.
- $q = 1$ is equivalent to $m=\{1,2,3\}$.
- $\text{END}_q = C(., 3q)$
- $\text{ADD}_q = A(3q-2) + A(3q-1) + A(3q)$
- $\text{LOSS}_q = L(3q-2) + L(3q-1) + L(3q)$
- $REV_q = R(3q-2) + R(3q-1) + R(3q)$
- Objective: generate long-run projections of $R(m)$ and $A(M)$ using parameters estimated from $\text{ADD}$, $\text{LOSS}$, $\text{END}$ and $\text{REV}$ numbers
- Account for **missing data**:
	- **Left-censoring** - Disclosure records of paying customers does not start from the beginning of commercial operations.
	- Some measures are reported for some period of time (e.g., $\text{END}$) before being complemented by other measures (e.g., $\text{ADD}$ and $\text{LOSS}$).
- Account for **aggregation** (quarterly reports to monthly figures)
	- Publicly disclosed customer data is typically reported quarterly with the associated unit of time being the quarter, whereas the firm is operating on a finer time interval (which, for the purposes of our analysis, we assume to be the month).
