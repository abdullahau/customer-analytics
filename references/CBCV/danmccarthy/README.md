Last summer I worked on a project that used Daniel McCarthy, Peter Fader and Bruce Hardie’s valuation model, described in their paper “Valuing Subscription-Based Businesses Using Publicly Disclosed Customer Data” available at SSRN.

I had to use an Excel-based optimization kindly provided by Dan Mccarthy, due to time constraints. But now I found time to replicate their model in R.

It’s in an earliest alpha version now, and does not optimize consistently. Moreover, I haven’t built a Shiny user interface due to a workload on my other projects.

However, if you are interested, you can find the code in the Github repo that I created specifically for that. You are welcome to contribute to the project. I will welcome your pull requests.

Ideally, the project will constitute an open-source user-friendly valuation calculator for subscription-based businesses.

Let’s combine our codes to make life easier for laymen!
