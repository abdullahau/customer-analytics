    "Central to diagnosing the performance of a new product is the decomposition of its total sales into trial, first repeat, second repeat, and so on, components. More formally, we are interested in creating a summary of purchasing that tells us for each unit of time (e.g., week), the cumulative number of people who have made a trial (i.e., first-ever) purchase, a first repeat (i.e., secondever) purchase, a second repeat purchase, and so on. We let $T(t)$ denote the cumulative number of people who have made a trial purchase by time $t$, and $R_{j}(t)$ denote the number of people who have made at least $j$ repeat purchases of the new product by time $t (j = 1, 2, 3, . . .)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With such a data summary in place, standard new product performance metrics such as “percent triers repeating” and “repeats per repeater” are easily computed from these data. At any point in time $t$, percent triers repeating is computed as $R_{1}(t)/T (t)$, while repeats per repeater is computed as $R(t)/R_{1}(t)$, where $R(t)$ is the total number of repeat purchases up to time $t$:"
